# To Do App with React

This project is a simple To Do application built with React, developed as part of my learning process. The goal of this project was to practice and understand the core concepts of React, including state management, component structure, and handling user input, while focusing on improving algorithmic thinking for task management functionality.

## ðŸ›  What You'll Find

- **Task Management**: Add, mark as complete, and delete tasks.
- **React Components**: Application broken down into functional components to manage UI and state efficiently.
- **State Management**: Use of React hooks like `useState` to handle task states.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The purpose of this project was to enhance my understanding of React through a hands-on approach to building a functional To Do application. It also helped me improve my algorithmic problem-solving skills while working on task-related logic.
